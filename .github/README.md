# homepage

![screenshot of start page](./homepage.png)

Here's my simple homepage. It imports bookmarks from `bookmarks.js`, colours from `~/.cache/wal/colors.css`, and a random image from the `art` folder.

[Live Preview](https://bean499.github.io/homepage/) - Note that colours and art will be broken in this preivew mode, since it can't import any from pywal or the `art` folder.
